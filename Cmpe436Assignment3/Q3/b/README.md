- (i):
In s0 and s2, if there is no `p`, there is a `r`.
`s0 |= (~p -> r)` holds
`s2 |= (~p -> r)` holds
- (ii):
Some future state has `t`.
`s0 |= (F t)` holds
`s2 |= (F t)` holds
- (iii):
Some future state has `q`.
`s0 |= (F q)` holds
`s2 |= (F q)` holds
- (iv):
All future states have either `r` or `q`.
`s0 |= (G (r v q))` holds
`s2 |= (G (r v q))` holds
